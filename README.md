# Data-Mini-1
Welcome to Data Mini #1! The dataframes provided are on K-12 student-teacher race matching in Texas public schools. The README.md file will have information about the dataset along with the rubric and policies. The CSV and the RDS are the same file, but the RDS will preserves R data types exactly (factors, dates, lists, etc.). Good luck
