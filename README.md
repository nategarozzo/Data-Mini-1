# Data-Mini-1
Welcome to Data Mini #1! You and your teammates will have 2 hours to explore and prepare a presentation about your data analysis. The hour after will be spent presenting your findings.

This Git repository contains this `README` file and the dataset in both `CSV` and `RDS` formats. This  `README` will include the dataset's dictionary, along with the rubric and policies. The `CSV` and the `RDS` have the same rows and columns, but the `RDS` will preserve R data types exactly (factors, dates, lists, etc.). We recommend you use Duke's Container Manager to access your preferred IDE.
